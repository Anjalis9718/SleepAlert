# SleepAlert
A real time sleep detector - for safety purpose alarm

In recent years, driver drowsiness has been one of the major causes of road accidents and can lead to severe physical injuries, deaths and significant economic losses. Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver drowsiness detection system which could alert the driver before a mishap happens. Researchers have attempted to determine driver drowsiness using the following measures: (1) vehicle-based measures; (2) behavioral measures and (3) physiological measures. A detailed review on these measures will provide insight on the present systems, issues associated with them and the enhancements that need to be done to make a robust system. In this paper, we review these three measures as to the sensors used and discuss the advantages and limitations of each. The various ways through which drowsiness has been experimentally manipulated is also discussed. We conclude that by designing a hybrid drowsiness detection system that combines non-intusive physiological measures with other measures one would accurately determine the drowsiness level of a driver. A number of road accidents might then be avoided if an alert is sent to a driver that is deemed drowsy.

## How it works?

If drivers do close their eyes for longer than expected -- generally anything longer than 1.6 seconds -- an alarm goes off in the truck, combining a noise and the vibration of a motor positioned in the seat. If it happens a second time, the dispatcher or controller will be alerted to the problem. They will then be able to chat to the driver over the radio to see if they are OK and whether they need a break. A third alarm generally means that the driver should be taken off duty to avoid accidents.

A Real-Time Sleep Detection and Warning System for Driver's Safety Based on EEG is proposed and implemented to ensure the safety for the drivers and pilots. This system is implemented to estimate and measure the driver attention, the percentage of oxygen in the blood of the driver and to check if driver is failing a sleep. The design and implementation of oxygen saturation sensor is also provided. In addition this system contains a Real time vital signs monitoring system to measure the vital signs values. The proposed system achieved an Accuracy of 96.3%, 100% of sensitivity, 92.4% of Predictability and 93% Specificity. The accuracy, predictability and specificity of the vital signs monitoring system is increased by 2%, 3% and 1%, respectively.

Not just detecting but also predicting impairment of a car driverâ€™s operational state is a challenge. This study aims to determine whether the standard sources of information used to detect drowsiness can also be used to predict when a given drowsiness level will be reached.

## Future Improvements

    The model will predict when critical impairment will occur.

    The Model accuracy will be greater with behavioral (eye and head) indicators.

    Driving time data will improve model detection and prediction performance.
    
    The computer vision algorithms will track human eye and eyelid behaviour, looking for the frequency of blinking, duration of blinks and the velocity of the eyelid.
