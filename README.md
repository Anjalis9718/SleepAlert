# SleepAlert
## A real time sleep detector - for safety purpose alarm

## Context

In recent years, driver drowsiness has been one of the major causes of road accidents and can lead to severe physical injuries, deaths and significant economic losses. Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver drowsiness detection system which could alert the driver before a mishap happens. 

## How does SleepAlert work?

If the users do close their eyes for longer than expected -- generally anything longer than 1.6 seconds -- an alarm message is shown, (it can be combined with a noise in future versions) and a log event is recorded.

Real-Time Sleep Detection and Warning Systems like this can be proposed and implemented to ensure the safety for the drivers and pilots, for example.

In critical environments this kind of system can help to estimate and measure the driver attention, the percentage of oxygen in the blood of the driver (when combined with an oxygen saturation sensor) and to check if driver is failing a sleep. In addition this kind of system can rely on a Real time vital signs monitoring system to measure the vital signs values (In critical environments). 

## Future Improvements

    The model will predict when critical impairment will occur.

    The Model accuracy will be greater with behavioral (eye and head) indicators.

    Driving time data will improve model detection and prediction performance.
    
    The computer vision algorithms will track human eye and eyelid behaviour, looking for the frequency of blinking, duration of blinks and the velocity of the eyelid.
